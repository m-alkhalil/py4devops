Dynamic Security Group Auditor

    Use Case: Audit AWS security groups for compliance and report issues.
    Details:
        Goal: Check all security groups in an AWS account for overly permissive rules (e.g., port 22 open to 0.0.0.0/0).
        Setup: Target an AWS account (use free tier or mock data if needed).
        Task: Query security group rules using an AWS SDK, compare them against a predefined “safe” policy (e.g., no public SSH), and flag violations.
        Output: A text file or console report listing risky rules (e.g., “SG-123: Port 22 open to all”).
    Why It’s Good: Shows cloud security awareness and automation—hot topics in DevOps.
    Resume Bullet: "Developed a Python tool to audit AWS security groups for compliance risks."

2. CI/CD Pipeline Validator

    Use Case: Validate a CI/CD configuration file before deployment.
    Details:
        Goal: Ensure a .yml file (e.g., for GitHub Actions or Jenkins) meets basic standards.
        Setup: Use a sample pipeline file (e.g., one with steps like build, test, deploy).
        Task: Parse the YAML, check for required fields (e.g., jobs, steps), and verify syntax or logic (e.g., no empty stages).
        Output: A pass/fail message (e.g., “Pipeline valid” or “Missing ‘test’ step”).
    Why It’s Good: Ties into CI/CD workflows, a must-know for DevOps roles.
    Resume Bullet: "Created a Python script to validate CI/CD pipeline configs for deployment readiness."

3. Resource Cleanup Scheduler

    Use Case: Identify and tag unused cloud resources for cleanup.
    Details:
        Goal: Find idle AWS resources (e.g., unattached EBS volumes) and mark them for review.
        Setup: Target an AWS account or simulate with dummy data.
        Task: Query EBS volumes (or similar), check attachment status, and apply a tag (e.g., CleanupCandidate=Yes) to idle ones.
        Output: A list of tagged resources with details (e.g., “Volume vol-123: 10GB, untagged”).
    Why It’s Good: Highlights cost optimization and resource management—valuable in cloud-heavy DevOps.
    Resume Bullet: "Built a Python tool to tag unused AWS EBS volumes for cleanup."

4. Custom Metrics Exporter

    Use Case: Collect system metrics and export them to a monitoring tool.
    Details:
        Goal: Gather CPU/memory stats from a local machine or VM and format them for a tool like Prometheus.
        Setup: Use a local system or a test VM (e.g., via Vagrant).
        Task: Pull system metrics (e.g., CPU usage, free memory) periodically, format as JSON or plaintext, and write to a file or send to a local endpoint.
        Output: A file or API payload (e.g., “cpu_usage: 45%, mem_free: 2GB”) consumable by monitoring systems.
    Why It’s Good: Shows monitoring skills and integration with observability tools—big in DevOps.
    Resume Bullet: "Designed a Python script to export custom system metrics for Prometheus monitoring."

Guidelines for These Use Cases

    Variety: These hit security, CI/CD, cost management, and monitoring—different from the first set’s focus on serverless, APIs, analytics, and config.
    Scope: Keep them simple but functional—aim for 50-100 lines of Python each.
    Realism: Use free-tier AWS, local VMs, or mock data to build them affordably.
    Portfolio Ready: Name each project clearly on GitHub (e.g., aws-sg-auditor, pipeline-validator) with a solid README.

This set gives you a broader range to flex on your resume and impress Jr. DevOps recruiters. Want me to refine any of these further or brainstorm another angle? You’re killing it—let’s keep the momentum!
