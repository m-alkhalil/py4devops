what you need for python for devops
1. Serverless Monitoring with AWS Lambda

    Use Case: Automate EC2 instance health checks and notifications.
    Details:
        Goal: Monitor a set of EC2 instances in AWS and alert if any stop unexpectedly.
        Setup: Use AWS Lambda with Python to run a function every 2 hours (triggered by CloudWatch Events).
        Task: Query EC2 instance statuses (e.g., running, stopped, terminated), filter for anomalies (e.g., stopped instances), and send an email or SMS alert via AWS SNS.
        Output: Log the status of all instances (healthy or not) to CloudWatch Logs for tracking.
    Why It’s Good: Shows cloud automation, serverless knowledge, and basic alerting—core DevOps skills.
    Resume Bullet: "Built an AWS Lambda function to monitor EC2 health and send SNS notifications every 2 hours."

2. Standalone API-Driven Resource Tracker

    Use Case: Fetch and log cloud resource details as a standalone tool.
    Details:
        Goal: Create a portable script to track AWS S3 bucket usage (or another API-driven service).
        Setup: Write a Python program that makes an API call to AWS (e.g., list S3 buckets and their sizes) or a public API (e.g., GitHub repos).
        Task: Parse the API response (JSON), extract key info (e.g., bucket name, size, last modified), and write it to a timestamped log file.
        Bonus: Containerize it with Docker so it can run anywhere (e.g., on a CI/CD runner).
        Output: A log file (e.g., s3_usage_2025-03-22.log) with readable resource details.
    Why It’s Good: Highlights API integration, file handling, and containerization—practical for DevOps workflows.
    Resume Bullet: "Developed a containerized Python tool to fetch and log S3 bucket details via AWS API."

3. Data Analytics for Log Trend Prediction

    Use Case: Analyze server logs to predict resource usage trends.
    Details:
        Goal: Process a sample log file (e.g., CPU or disk usage) and predict future trends.
        Setup: Use a CSV or text file with dummy server metrics (e.g., timestamp, CPU %, disk GB used—you can generate this yourself).
        Task: Load data with pandas, calculate averages or trends (e.g., disk usage increasing 5% daily), and visualize it with matplotlib (e.g., a line graph).
        Output: A PNG chart showing the trend and a short text summary (e.g., “Disk usage will hit 90% in 10 days”).
    Why It’s Good: Shows data handling and visualization skills, useful for monitoring and reporting in DevOps.
    Resume Bullet: "Created a Python analytics tool using pandas and matplotlib to predict server resource trends from logs."

4. Automation for Server Configuration Checks

    Use Case: Verify server configurations across multiple instances.
    Details:
        Goal: Check if a set of servers (local VMs or cloud instances) meet a baseline config.
        Setup: Simulate 2-3 servers (e.g., using Vagrant locally or EC2) with a config file (e.g., /etc/app.conf).
        Task: Write a Python script to SSH into each server (or mock it locally), read the config file, and compare it to a “gold standard” (e.g., a predefined key-value pair like timeout=30).
        Output: A report (text file or console) listing which servers pass or fail (e.g., “Server1: OK, Server2: timeout mismatch”).
    Why It’s Good: Demonstrates automation, remote management, and config validation—key for infrastructure tasks.
    Resume Bullet: "Designed a Python script to automate server config verification across multiple instances."

Guidelines for Implementation

    Keep It Simple: Focus on functionality over perfection—entry-level roles value working projects.
    Modularize: Break each into small functions (e.g., get_ec2_status(), send_alert()) for readability.
    Document: Add a README on GitHub with setup steps and purpose—shows professionalism.
    Test Locally: Use free-tier AWS, local VMs, or mock data to avoid costs.
    Stretch Goals: Add error handling (e.g., API fails) or basic logging to impress.
